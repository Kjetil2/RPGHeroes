I Tried to create a Console Application in .NET 
I used .Net 6.0
I was given some guidelinse to how i could create it an minimum requierments.

I didn't meet those requierment, but i manage to create several classes, methodes, Attributes and Constructor's.

I struggel alot with the calculation. And i did not got time to do the testes. 

I didn't finished the Assignment. Most of all i need to practice more to do this in a week.
But I learnd a lot of this project. And hopfully i can finish it one day.
